* SQL to create businesses tables:
    - CREATE TABLE businesses (business_id varchar (50) PRIMARY KEY, business_name varchar (50) NOT NULL, business_alias varchar (50) NOT NULL, rating numeric, location varchar (150));
    - CREATE TABLE business_categories (business_id varchar (50) NOT NULL, category_id int NOT NULL);

* If the db gets erased, run these commands to re-insert categories table:

docker cp yab-db/insert_categories.sql [yabdb_docker container id]:insert_categories.sql
docker exec -u postgres [yabdb_docker container id] psql yab_db postgres -f insert_categories.sql

In order for Google Maps JavaScript API to work, I need to enable billing. This is the error I get when using react-places-autocomplete:

"You must enable Billing on the Google Cloud Project at https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/billing/enable Learn more at https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started Places API error: BillingNotEnabledMapError
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/error-messages#billing-not-enabled-map-error"

It requires me to make an account and put my credit card in. I don't *need* this right now so let me continue to work on something else then I can decide later what I want to do about this. 

Here is a link to the react-places-autocomplete npm / git repo: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-places-autocomplete
I can use it by putting "<LocationSearchInput/>" into my code in YelpSearch.js.
